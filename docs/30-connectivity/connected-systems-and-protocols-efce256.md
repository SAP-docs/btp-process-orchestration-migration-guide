# Connected Systems and Protocols

When you analyze your SAP Process Orchestration system, the first step is to extract as many details as possible with regards to what systems it connects to and which transport and messaging protocols it uses.

This information about connected systems and protocols can then be further analyzed to identify any issues or challenges ahead, and to allow for an estimation of the effort required to migrate to a Cloud Integration tenant solution.

To extract this information, use one of the following methods:

1.  Use the Migration Assessment capability of SAP Integration Suite. With this tool, you can extract the integration scenarios from your SAP Process Orchestration system and evaluate them regarding the technical effort of migrating them to SAP Integration Suite. See [Assessing the Migration Strategy and Migrating Content](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/assessing-migration-strategy-and-migrating-content?locale=en-US&version=CLOUD).

2.  Use the standard Web Services that are available as part of the Integration Directory API. For details on this method, see the blog [SAP PI/PO Directory API: Extract detailed Communication Channel configurations into an Excel sheet without custom codes/macros](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/11/07/sap-pipo-directory-api-extract-detailed-communication-channel-configurations-into-an-excel-sheet-without-custom-codesmacros/).
