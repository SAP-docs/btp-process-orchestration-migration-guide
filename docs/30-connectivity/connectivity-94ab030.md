# Connectivity

Get an overview of the important aspects regarding the connectivity migration, for example, where it’s necessary to identify the systems in use, their protocols, if custom adapters are used, and more.

-   **[Steps in a Migration](steps-in-a-migration-6130825.md "Follows these several structured steps to migrate your communication channels from an
		SAP Process Orchestration format to a Cloud Integration format.")**  
Follows these several structured steps to migrate your communication channels from an SAP Process Orchestration format to a Cloud Integration format.
-   **[Connected Systems and Protocols](connected-systems-and-protocols-efce256.md "When you analyze your SAP Process Orchestration system, the first step is to extract as many details as possible with regards to what
		systems it connects to and which transport and messaging protocols it uses.")**  
When you analyze your SAP Process Orchestration system, the first step is to extract as many details as possible with regards to what systems it connects to and which transport and messaging protocols it uses.
-   **[Standard Adapter Migration](standard-adapter-migration-2622c30.md "SAP Process Orchestration provides many adapter types as standard. Depending on the
		adapter type, an equivalent may be available in Cloud Integration, or an alternative may
		need to be used. ")**  
SAP Process Orchestration provides many adapter types as standard. Depending on the adapter type, an equivalent may be available in Cloud Integration, or an alternative may need to be used.
-   **[Custom Adapter Migration](custom-adapter-migration-32b9799.md "If you, or your implementation partner, have implemented fully bespoke adapters for SAP
		Process Orchestration, you may need to have these reimplemented using the Adapter
		Development Kit (ADK) provided for Cloud Integration. ")**  
If you, or your implementation partner, have implemented fully bespoke adapters for SAP Process Orchestration, you may need to have these reimplemented using the Adapter Development Kit \(ADK\) provided for Cloud Integration.
-   **[Adapter Modules](adapter-modules-e402f4a.md "Learn about the differences between adapter modules in SAP Process Orchestration and in
		Cloud Integration, and how you can redesign the adapter modules.")**  
Learn about the differences between adapter modules in SAP Process Orchestration and in Cloud Integration, and how you can redesign the adapter modules.
-   **[Linking Communication Channels to Interfaces](linking-communication-channels-to-interfaces-2ecd2a8.md "In Cloud Integration, there’s no separation between the communication channels and the
		other artifacts (such as Message Mapping Schema definitions) that make up an interface. It’s
		therefore key to understand which communication channels are used by which interfaces as the
		same channel can be used by more than one interface.")**  
In Cloud Integration, there’s no separation between the communication channels and the other artifacts \(such as Message Mapping Schema definitions\) that make up an interface. It’s therefore key to understand which communication channels are used by which interfaces as the same channel can be used by more than one interface.
-   **[Migration of Value Mappings](migration-of-value-mappings-f2621ed.md "Learn how you can import value mappings from SAP Process Orchestration to Cloud
		Integration.")**  
Learn how you can import value mappings from SAP Process Orchestration to Cloud Integration.
-   **[Connecting to On-Premise Systems Using Cloud Connector](connecting-to-on-premise-systems-using-cloud-connector-de83ef5.md "Find out how Cloud Connector can help you to connect cloud-based services and on-premise
		systems.")**  
Find out how Cloud Connector can help you to connect cloud-based services and on-premise systems.
