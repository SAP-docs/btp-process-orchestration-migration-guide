# Test Automation

As part of the testing phase in every migration project, several products on the market help you to create automatic testing scenarios. Test automation reduces risks to critical business processes and lowers the human effort to cover the test tasks of your interfaces.

Some of these tools support different SAP products \(for example, SAP Process Orchestration, Cloud Integration\) and can be used not only in the project but also in the future developments and maintenance. Note that itâ€™s important to verify the pricing conditions for each product.

For example, regression and test tools for your migration to the cloud are provided by our partner companies Int4 and Figaf. Read about their test automation tools in the blog [Leverage free test automation tools to accelerate your migration from SAP Process Orchestration to SAP Integration Suite](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/28/leverage-free-test-automation-tools-to-accelerate-your-migration-from-sap-process-orchestration-to-sap-integration-suite/).

Additional tools are available from SAP's partner ecosystem at [SAP Store](https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/search/Integration%20testing).
