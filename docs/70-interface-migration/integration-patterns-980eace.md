# Integration Patterns

Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf have detailed a catalog of 65 common patterns in Enterprise Application Integration \(EAI\) scenarios in the book titled *Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions* \(Addison-Wesley, 2003\). SAP published a blog about implementing [Integration Patterns on SAP Process Orchestration](https://blogs.sap.com/2012/09/15/sap-process-orchestration-integration-patterns/).

An **Integration Flow Design Guidelines â€“ Enterprise Integration Patterns** package is available on the [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](http://api.sap.com/), where you can find more information on how to configure and use different integration patterns. It also contains sample integration flows, which can be used to test integration patterns on a Cloud Integration tenant or on SAP Process Orchestration 7.5.

The next chapters describe the following patterns and how to implement them in SAP Process Orchestration and Cloud Integration:
