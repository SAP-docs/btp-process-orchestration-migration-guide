# Integration Patterns

Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf have detailed a catalog of 65 common patterns in Enterprise Application Integration \(EAI\) scenarios in the book titled *Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions* \(Addison-Wesley, 2003\). SAP published a blog about implementing [Integration Patterns on SAP Process Orchestration](https://blogs.sap.com/2012/09/15/sap-process-orchestration-integration-patterns/).

An **Integration Flow Design Guidelines â€“ Enterprise Integration Patterns** package is available on the [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](http://api.sap.com/), where you can find more information on how to configure and use different integration patterns. It also contains sample integration flows, which can be used to test integration patterns on a Cloud Integration tenant or on SAP Process Orchestration 7.5.

The next chapters describe the following patterns and how to implement them in SAP Process Orchestration and Cloud Integration:

-   [Aggregator](aggregator-8cfddfc.md)

-   [Splitter](splitter-64ae559.md)

-   [Scatter-Gather](scatter-gather-0a8582f.md)

-   [Composed Message Processor](composed-message-processor-9ade128.md)

-   [Content-Based Routing](content-based-routing-147229c.md)

-   [Recipient List](recipient-list-9df9086.md)

-   [Message Filter](message-filter-bf613cf.md)

-   [Content Filter](content-filter-627d65c.md)

-   [Content Enricher](content-enricher-d86ba3f.md)


> ### Note:  
> SAP Business Process Management \(BPM\) complements SAP Process Integration for certain integration patterns. There are system-centric and user-centric processes:
> 
> -   System-centric processes
> 
>     A system-centric process can be implemented using SAP Integration Suite. For more details, see [Interface Design and Implementation](interface-design-and-implementation-b763478.md).
> 
> -   user-centric processes
> 
>     For implementing user-centric processes, it is recommended to evaluate SAP Build Process Automation. For more details, see [SAP Build Process Automation](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-process-automation?locale=en-US&version=Cloud).
