# Interface Design and Implementation

In a migration project, you may need to redesign a particular integration flow or develop one from scratch in an implementation project.

The Cloud Integration web UI provides a modeling environment that allows you to design the details of message processing \(its senders and receivers as well as the individual processing steps\) with a graphical user interface. For a comprehensive description of the main aspects when starting the development of a new interface, see [Getting Started with Integration Flow Development](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/e5724cd84b854719973afe0356ea128b.html).

In general, an integration flow contains the following aspects:

-   The senders and receivers of the message

-   How the senders and receivers are connected to the tenant \(adapters\)

-   The steps that define the message processing

Migration Tooling, a feature in the Cloud Integration capability, can help you migrate your integration artifacts from SAP Process Orchestration to SAP Integration Suite. See [Migration Tooling](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_INTEGRATION_SUITE/51ab953548be4459bfe8539ecaeee98d/60610163aec44849ac4783c92fb2e55c.html?locale=en-US&version=CLOUD).
