## SAP Process Orchestration Monitoring

In SAP Process Orchestration, the following monitors support you in your daily operations and troubleshooting:



### Message Monitor

Using the message monitor in SAP NetWeaver Administrator, you can monitor the processing of messages on the Advanced Adapter Engine. You can use message monitoring in the following cases:

-   To create an overview of message processing. Message overview also provides two different modes for searching messages.

-   To track the status of messages.

-   To find errors that have occurred and to establish what caused them.


You can also search for messages that were persisted in the database, or for messages that have already been archived.



### Communication Channel Monitor

Use the communication channel monitor to obtain information about communication channels that are set up for the Advanced Adapter Engine. You can also perform some administrative activities.

If the Advanced Adapter Engine runs on a server cluster, the communication channels comprise multiple instances for the various cluster nodes.



### IDoc Adapter Monitor

Use the IDoc message monitor to search for IDoc messages processed in the adapter. Based on the various parameters of the IDoc message you provide as search criteria, the monitor retrieves the messages and displays information about them.

For more information, see [Displaying IDoc Messages](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5cf7d2de571a45cc81f91261668b7361/7.5.latest/en-US/de82c727b3d94714a04a4a579663fcf5.html).

It's also possible to use the IDoc metadata monitor to display IDoc metadata information and clear the metadata for the selected IDoc type from the cache.



### Adapter Engine Status

Use the adapter engine status to get information about the adapter engine, queues, message traffic \(e.g. number of asynchronous or synchronous messages\), database locks, overview of messages \(being\) processed per sender, and receiver components.



### Channel-Independent Logs

Use the channel-independent logs to display execution steps of adapters that can't be assigned to a particular communication channel.



### Cache Monitor

Use the cache monitor to display objects that are currently in the runtime cache of the Advanced Adapter Engine and the Mapping Runtime. You can enter selection criteria to search for current objects in the runtime cache and review the details of a selected object.



### Performance Monitor

Use the performance monitor to inspect the processed data by intervals of time and their processing time for individual adapters.



### CPA Cache History

Use the CPA cache history to display an overview of cache refresh actions and their statuses.



### Background Job Monitor

Displays an overview of background jobs \(adapter engine, adapter framework scheduler jobs, etc.\) and offers the ability to manage them.

## Cloud Integration Monitoring

In Cloud Integration, a message monitor allows you to display the processed messages and their statuses, logs, and traces. Compared to SAP Process Orchestration, there are less monitors because you don’t have such components like Adapter Engine, or you don’t perform as many administrative tasks since some of these are part of SAP’s platform support service. You also don’t have monitors such as Cache Monitor, Metadata Monitor, Adapter Engine Monitor, and Communication Channel Monitor. For more details about the message monitor and its capabilities, see [Guidelines and Best Practices for Message Monitoring](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/6f598b4d4e0e44c3bd8445b5d58b832c.html).

Cloud Integration isn't delivered with pre-built out-of-the-box alert capabilities, but you can use a predelivered package that uses the SAP Alert Notification service for SAP BTP to send alerts of failure of integration flows. You can also create your own integration using the available APIs to read the Cloud Integration tenant content.

For more information, see the following blogs:

-   [Creating Custom Alert Notifications in SAP Integration Suite](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/07/31/creating-custom-alert-notifications-in-sap-cloud-platform-integration-suite/)

-   [Receive Notifications for Failed SAP Cloud Integration Flows via Any Channel with Alert Notification](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/10/14/receive-notifications-for-failed-sap-cloud-platform-integration-flows-via-any-channel-with-alert-notification/)


For a comprehensive walkthrough of the capabilities of the SAP Alert Notification service, review this [blog series about SAP Alert Notification](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/06/05/sap-cloud-platform-alert-notification-is-now-generally-available/).

If the standard capabilities of the SAP Alert Notification service aren't sufficient to meet customer requirements, or there's no external system or service like SAP Solution Manager to generate alert notifications, integration flows that invoke calls to the standard APIs published by the SAP Alert Notification service can be built within Cloud Integration. Full documentation of these APIs can be found on the [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/AlertNotification/rest). Another option is to combine the exception subprocesses while developing your integration flow with some procedure to collect the error/success message and send it via email. For details, see the blog [How to send a mail from SAP Cloud Platform Integration](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/01/17/how-to-send-a-mail-from-sap-cloud-platform-integration/).
