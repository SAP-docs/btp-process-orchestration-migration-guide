Find out more about the API Management capability.

The API Management capability comes with the objective to create an enterprise-wide governance, secure and harmonized experience for customers, partners and employees while consuming exposed APIs. API Management isn't only a service to gateway some particular API, but it also counts with a try-subscribe developer portal for external parties, real-time insights, and analytics on the API traffic and meter/monetization possibilities.
